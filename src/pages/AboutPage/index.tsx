                Cassandra is not only an incredible UX designer, but she has also been incredible human to have worked with. As her manager, I got a front row
                seat to how she approaches problems, how she shows empathy for user needs at every step of the UX process, and cares deeply about the outcome
                and impact of her work. She has tackled several complex products, from energy companies to streaming services, always with a wholistic and
                thoughtful view of the product and how to put the user first- while still incorporating business goals. She is smart; hard working, and I
                believe has only had the opportunity to scratch the surface of what she is capable of. I hope that her next opportunity opens all of the doors I
                wish she had access to here and I’m thankful to have known her and been a small part of her career journey.

                I’ve had the pleasure of working with Cassandra for the past 7 years and have been consistently impressed by her design abilities, strong
                teamwork skills, and dedication. Her attention to detail is amazing and her ability to meticulously craft and fine-tune designs sets her apart
                from others in the industry. Cassandra is also an extremely talented character artist and animator. Her creative talents were invaluable during
                our time working together at IDSI and her ability to bring ideas to life through her art and animations is truly remarkable. She has a natural
                ability to create stunning visuals and is always eager to take on new challenges. She is not afraid to step out of her comfort zone with a
                willingness to adapt and learn quickly. In addition to her design talents, Cassandra is a great communicator and has the ability to work
                effectively in a team environment or on individual tasks. She is a true team player and is always willing to go above and beyond. Cassandra will
                make an exceptional addition to any design team and I look forward to the chance to work together again in the future. Cassandra’s expertise in
                UX/UI design was essential in helping our team deliver high-quality products with a user-centered approach. She was able to work closely with
                our product owners and stakeholders to understand their needs and translate them into effective design solutions. What impressed me most about
                Cassandra was their ability to work within the framework of Scrum, always keeping in mind the iterative and incremental nature of our work. She
                was always willing to adapt and pivot as needed to ensure that our team remained on track and aligned with our goals. Overall, I highly
                recommend Cassandra for any UX/UI design role. Cassandra is an exceptional team player, a great communicator, and a true asset to any agile
                team.

                Cassandra is a wonderful designer who regularly surprised me with her range of talents – not only is she a quick learner who’s able to unpack
                complex business, user and technical requirements, she can also whip out impressive illustrations in seconds, create meaningful educational
                materials for meaty subjects, and is a champion of any game you throw her way. I hope to have the opportunity to work with Cassandra again, and
                would recommend her 10/10.

                Cassandra is an exceedingly talented artist and designer who can just as easily realize stylish, modern user interfaces as she can concept out
                fun and interesting character designs. I worked with Cassandra for two years as a software developer on multiple projects, all of which were
                vastly improved by her contributions, both in quality and development time. She is a pleasure to work with, constantly practicing her craft, and
                encourages others to want to improve their own skills. I would recommend Cassandra for any art or design project without hesitation.

                A multi-talented artist, designer, and illustrator, Cassandra sets a standard of excellence and attention for detail in her work. Over the
                course of about two years working with Cassandra, I was always amazed by her ability to handle the toughest design requests, effortlessly with
                such short notice. She has excelled beyond the core elements of design by branching out and adapting her work to fit with developing game
                engines and mobile applications. With every project she was involved in, from game jams to marketing, she always brought with her a positive
                energy and a resolve to create the sharpest looking product. Cassandra is a fantastic team player for any position requiring design and art.
